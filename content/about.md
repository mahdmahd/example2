## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

## 🤓 My Story
Two years ago,  I finished my medical School and began my career as a full-time medical doctor in Tehran, Iran. but ,as the time went on,I realized that I love mathematics and statistics, and I enjoy applying my medical background to work with large medical datasets so I started working as a part-time data analyst at the Minimally Invasive Surgery Research Center under the supervision of Dr. KermanSaravi and Dr. Shahabi. This collaboration led to  projects such as **Weight Loss Trajectory of Patients After Bariatric Surgery** **Hypoalbuminemia Prediction Scoring After OAGB** and **Measuring Biliopancreatic Limb Length Using a Computer Vision Approach** In these projects, I served as a data scientist . Before that, I gained experience working with **medical imaging data**, specifically brain MRIs, while completing my MD degree thesis on **"Analyzing Brain MRI Features Among Different Subtypes of Frontotemporal Dementia”** While working on my thesis, I was fortunate to gain experience using tools like SPM and FreeSurfer for analyzing neuroimaging data.
